### Square Kufic

Square Kufic is a stylized version of the archaic Kufic script that features geometric, rectangular, quadrangular, and rectilinear elements. Together they form a composition of meaningful words.

### The Name

The script possesses a distinctive style constructed from squares, giving rise to several names by which it is recognized, including Square Kufic, Bannai script, Checkered Kufic, and Geometric Kufic.

### Origin

Square Kufic originated from Islamic culture, emerged as a distinctive art, design, and craft style employed by early Muslim Caliphs and rulers for the purpose of conveying messages.

### Journey

Over time, Square Kufic, as a form of expression, was further refined and expanded by skilled Muslim craftsmen and enthusiasts across numerous regions in Asia, the middle east and north Africa.

### Thousand Years Old

Historical records of Square Kufic date back to the time after 1000 A.D. Square Kufic was originally created in Iranian architecture with bricks and tiles functioning as pixels.

### Usage of Kufi

Artisans employ the Kufi calligraphic style, known for transforming the traditional curves into straight lines and sharp angles, alternating glazed and bare bricks to write out prayers or replicate geometric patterns.

### Languages

It uses Arabic alphabet as the main base elements in the designs and can extend to all other languages which uses Arabic script as a writing languages with all the letters variations and alterations.

### Emergence

Square Kufic initially emerged predominantly on religious structures, specifically mosque minarets, palaces gates, inner domes and grand architectural edifices and facades.

### Inspiration

Although debatable, it is believed that Square Kufic calligraphy style was a result of a combination between the usage of Kufi script and an inspiration by Chinese seal script which follows same design rules.

### Clay and Ceramics

The origins of Square Kufic can be traced back to its initial use with clay bricks. Over time, its artistic prowess flourished, becoming renowned for its exquisite depiction on ceramic panels.

### What we know

Our understanding of Square Kufic relies on contemporary observations and analyses of historical designs, as there is currently no existing ancient written documentation that describes this style.

### Readability is not Important

Square Kufic is decorative form of Islamic calligraphy which focuses on the visual form of the letters. Its primary purpose is to create an aesthetic form rather than communicate a message.

### Follows a Grid System

Square Kufic follows a grid system. Usually it’s a 1×1 grid but in modern square Kufic, grids are now more flexible and can go wild with angular and irregular shape grid systems.

### Problem Solving

With every added square, the number of empty spaces you have to work with gradually decreases. As such, a great deal of thought and contemplation is required to complete the artwork.

### Decorative not Informative

There are two forms of calligraphy. Decorative focuses on the visual form of the letters, while communicative is intended to convey a message. Square Kufic is a decorative form.

### Absence of Diacritics

Although diacritics play an important role in Arabic writing system, they seem to be absent in Square Kufic. Even in modern SK artworks, they do not exist. You may try to be the first to use them!

### Odd Squares

The rule of number of squares to be placed side by side is at least 3 Squares for each line, or 5, 7, 9.. etc. This rule cannot be broken or manipulated in any letter whatsoever.

### Solid and the Void

The balance between the filled and the blank, the yes and the no, the solid and the void are the base philosophy of Square Kufic. Equal distribution of squares will result in a balanced artwork.

### Dots are not Essential

Old Square Kufic had no dots in it although dots were introduced earlier to its first creation. Currently dots are being used in SK designs but they are still not an essential part of it.

### Rotation of Letters

Letters can rotate in any direction 90°,180°,270°, clockwise or counterclockwise, As long as you’re following your own lead. This rotation will add an aesthetic look on the final artwork.

### Designed in 2D and 3D

While old Square Kufic artworks were mainly visualized in 2D, modern SK artworks represented the same in 2 dimensional artworks giving the artform a new level of aesthetics.

## Rotation of words, letters and sentences

### Letters, words and sentences can rotate in any direction as long as the designer is following their own lead and the flow of words is consistent.

## Solid weight ranges from hairline to black

### Solid weight from Hairline to Black but weights are never mixed in one design because it will damage the basic concept of balance in Square Kufic.
