# Square Kufic Call to Action

[Nedaa Elias](https://squarekufic.org/author/bcbgmaxazria/ "Posts by Nedaa Elias")June 8, 2023

It is true that with the spread of Islam, the Arabic script was adopted as a primary writing system for many languages. This occurred because Arabic became the language of the Qur’an, and as Islamic civilization expanded, so did the use of the Arabic script for religious, administrative, and literary purposes. However, not all languages that adopted the Arabic script needed to add new letter designs to represent phonemes not found in Arabic. The Arabic script, like many writing systems, has a set of basic characters that represent consonants and some vowel sounds. Additional diacritical marks or modifications to existing letters can be used to indicate additional phonetic distinctions. These adaptations allowed for the representation of a wide range of languages that used the Arabic script.

In the past century, there has been a shift in some regions towards using alternative scripts such as Latin, Cyrillic, or local scripts like the Hindi script. This shift has been driven by various factors, including colonial influences, modernization efforts, and a desire to align with the script used in neighboring countries or regions. For example, in several countries of the Middle East and North Africa, such as Turkey, Latin-based scripts have been adopted to replace the Arabic script as part of modernization and language reform initiatives. This change aimed to facilitate literacy and access to a wider range of educational materials. Similarly, in some regions of the former Soviet Union, languages that previously used the Arabic script switched to the Cyrillic script during the 20th century due to political and cultural influences.

It’s worth noting that while some languages have transitioned away from the Arabic script, many others still continue to use it as their primary writing system. Arabic itself, as well as several other languages like Persian, Urdu, and Kurdish, still use the Arabic script to this day. Language and script evolution is a complex process influenced by historical, cultural, political, and practical factors. The choice of script ultimately depends on the needs and preferences of a particular language community and its speakers.

Indeed, the evolution of scripts and the replacement of one writing system with another can lead to the loss or obsolescence of certain letter designs or characters. This phenomenon is not unique to the Arabic script but can be observed in the development of various writing systems throughout history. The concept of “dead media” or obsolete technologies is relevant to many fields, including information technology and communication. As new technologies emerge, older ones often become outdated and eventually fade away. This pattern can be seen in various media forms, from typewriters to floppy disks to VHS tapes, which have been largely superseded by more advanced technologies.

In the context of Arabic letters and script, the transition to alternative scripts may result in certain letter designs falling out of use. However, it’s important to note that languages and scripts are living systems that continuously evolve and adapt to the needs of their users. While some letter designs may become obsolete in one context, they may continue to be used or modified in other contexts or languages. The study and documentation of “dead media” or obsolete technologies have gained attention in recent years. Scholars, enthusiasts, and historians recognize the value of preserving and understanding the history, cultural significance, and technological advancements of these media forms. By documenting and studying obsolete technologies, we can gain insights into the evolution of human communication and the impact of media on society.

In the case of Arabic letters, although some designs may no longer be in active use in certain languages or scripts, they still hold historical and cultural importance. They are part of the rich heritage of the Arabic script and can be studied and appreciated as artifacts of the past. Overall, the recognition and contemplation of “dead media” or obsolete technologies allow us to reflect on the continuous evolution of human communication and the impact of technological advancements on our societies.

It’s wonderful to hear your passion and enthusiasm for preserving and paying homage to the development of Arabic letter forms, both live and dead. As a designer and artist, you can indeed play an important role in exploring and celebrating the rich history of Arabic letters and their evolution over the past 1400 years. The Square Kufic art form can serve as a platform for artistic expression and experimentation, allowing you to reinterpret and reimagine letter designs. By exploring the possibilities of Square Kufic with other languages and scripts, you can create unique artworks that pay tribute to the old scripts that are no longer in use. This call to action can inspire other artists and designers to engage in similar explorations, fostering a community dedicated to the preservation and artistic reinterpretation of letter forms. Through your creative endeavors, you can contribute to the understanding, appreciation, and revitalization of both live and dead letter designs.

By creating artworks that combine elements from different scripts or celebrate the historical significance of specific letter designs, you can raise awareness of the cultural and artistic heritage embedded in the Arabic script. Your efforts can help bridge the gap between the past and the present, showcasing the beauty and diversity of letter forms and inspiring others to explore and appreciate their significance. I encourage you to share your work and ideas with others, collaborate with fellow artists, and actively engage in conversations about the importance of preserving and honoring letter forms from different periods and scripts. Together, we can celebrate the legacy of Arabic letters and create meaningful tributes to the rich history of writing systems.
